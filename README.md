# SCFirstOrderLogic

Basic but fully documented and extensible [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic) implementations.

Created just for fun while reading chapters 8 and 9 of _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_ (3rd Edition - [ISBN 978-1292153964](https://www.google.com/search?q=isbn+978-1292153964)) - so may prove interesting to the .NET-inclined reading the same book.
The ["official" C# repository](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-csharp/tree/master/aima-csharp) for the book does of course cover these chapters, but given that what I've found there isn't (IMHO) very useful, here we are.
The main goal here is for it to be a learning resource. As such, care has been taken to include decent XML documentation, explanatory inline comments where appropriate, and functionality for explaining the results of queries.
For production scenarios, there are obviously other better inference engines out there - that generally use more powerful logics than first-order.

For usage guidance, please consult the [user guide](./docs/user-guide).
