## Issues and Contributions

I'm not expecting anyone to want to get involved given the low download figures on NuGet, but please feel free to do so.
I do keep a vague eye on the [issues](https://github.com/sdcondon/SCFirstOrderLogic/issues) tab, and will add a CONTRIBUTING.md if anyone drops me a message expressing interest.
Do bear in mind that I have a very particular scope in mind for the library, though.
When we reach the point where I feel that it does a good job of its "learning and experimenting" remit and offers sufficient means of extension, I'll view it as done (and suggest that any extensions belong in their own packages).

## See Also

Like this? If so, it might also be worth checking out:

* [SCClassicalPlanning](https://github.com/sdcondon/SCClassicalPlanning): Basic classical planning implementations. Based on chapter 10 of "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" - though perhaps a _little_ more loosely than this repo is based on chapters 8 and 9. Specifically, introduces a couple more PDDL concepts that the book doesn't bother with (but should IMO). Depends on this library (and [SCGraphTheory.Search](https://github.com/sdcondon/SCGraphTheory.Search)).
* [SCPropositionalLogic](https://github.com/sdcondon/SCPropositionalLogic): Basic propositional logic implementations. Based on chapter 7 of "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach". Mostly just a precursor to this repo - I haven't bothered publishing this one to NuGet - but might be of use if you find this repo a bit too much.
* [AIMA Code - C#](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-csharp): I mention this only because I feel like I should. This is the "official" C# repository for "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" - and it is.. err.. not great.
* [My GitHub Profile](https://github.com/sdcondon): My profile README lists a whole bunch of stuff that I've made.
