# SCFirstOrderLogic

Basic but fully documented and extensible [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic) implementations.

Created just for fun while reading chapters 8 and 9 of _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_ (3rd Edition - [ISBN 978-1292153964](https://www.google.com/search?q=isbn+978-1292153964) - so may prove interesting to the .NET-inclined reading the same book.
The main goal here is for it to be a learning resource - as such, care has been taken to include decent XML documentation and explanatory inline comments where appropriate.
For real-world scenarios, there are other better inference engines out there - that use more powerful logics than first-order (Bayesian logic - see infer.net, Fuzzy logic, ..).

For usage guidance, please consult the [user guide](./docs/user-guide).
