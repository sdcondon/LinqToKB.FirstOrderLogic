You might also be interested in:

* My other AI-related stuff: 
  * [SCClassicalPlanning](https://sdcondon.net/SCClassicalPlanning): Basic classical planning implementations. Based on chapter 10 of "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" - though perhaps a _little_ more loosely than this repo is based on chapters 8 and 9. Specifically, introduces a couple more PDDL concepts that the book doesn't bother with (but should IMO). Depends on this library (and [SCGraphTheory.Search](https://github.com/sdcondon/SCGraphTheory.Search)).
  * [SCPropositionalLogic](https://github.com/sdcondon/SCPropositionalLogic): Basic propositional logic implementations. Based on chapter 7 of "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach". Mostly just a precursor to this repo - I haven't bothered publishing this one to NuGet - but might be of use if you find this repo a bit too much.
* A selection of other people's AI-related stuff:
  * [Infer.NET](https://dotnet.github.io/infer/): Bayesian inference engine. Bayesian logic of course being strictly more powerful than first-order logic.
  * [AIMA Code - C#](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-csharp): I mention this only because I feel like I should. This is the "official" C# repository for "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" - and it is.. err.. not great.
