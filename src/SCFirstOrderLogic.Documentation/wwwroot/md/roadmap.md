# Roadmap

Long-term, this library will be "done" when I think that it does its "learning and experimentation" job adequately, and provides enough extension points for people to extend it should they so wish - perhaps even to the point of being useful in a production scenario.
I don't intend to add any particularly powerful or specialised inference logic to this package - the simple implementations suffice for its purpose.

Priorities at the time of writing:

* Improvements in the area of query execution robustness (in the face of re-execution, re-entry etc)
* Take a look at creating a FoL syntax parser in the SentenceCreation namespace.
* *As always, anything that's labelled as TODO in the code. Clone the repo and use your IDE's TODO/Task list functionality (TODOs are generally expressed as `// TODO..` or `/// TODO`) to see individual things I want to do.*

Breaking changes on the list for v4 (though there's no particular timeline for this):

* Revisit sentence formatting

On the back-burner, for later consideration:

* *Nothing at the mo*
