# Roadmap

Long-term, this library will be "done" when I think that it does its "learning and experimentation" job adequately, and provides enough extension points for people to extend it should they so wish.
In particular, I don't intend to add any particularly powerful or complex inference logic to this package - the simple implementations are enough.

Priorities at the time of writing:

* Take a look at creating a FoL syntax parser in the SentenceCreation namespace.
* *As always, anything that's labelled as TODO in the code. Clone the repo and use your IDE's TODO/Task list functionality (TODOs are generally expressed as `// TODO..` or `/// TODO`) to see individual things I want to do.*

Breaking changes on the list for v4:

* Revisit sentence formatting

On the back-burner, for later consideration:

* *Nothing at the mo*
