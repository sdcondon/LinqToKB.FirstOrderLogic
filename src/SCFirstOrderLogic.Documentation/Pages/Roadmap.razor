<h1>Roadmap</h1>

<p>Clone the repo and use your IDE's TODO/Task list functionality (TODOs are generally expressed as `// TODO..`) to see individual things I want to do.
This library will be "done" when I think that it does its "learning and experimentation" job adequately, and provides enough extension points for people to build on it should they so wish.</p>

<p>Priorities at the time of writing:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Find and zap any remaining bugs - not seen any new issues in my usage of this for a while now, so cautiously optimistic</li>
</ul>

<p>Breaking changes lined up for v3:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Probably change the ref params in ..Visitor{TState} classes - was thinking about value types,
    but most of the time this isn't what we will want - can always add ..RefVisitor{TState}, or ..VisitorR{TState}</li>
    <li>Rule indexing support in the chaining knowledge bases - something similar to resolution's IClauseStore.
    Will probably involve breaking changes to ctor of these KBs.</li>
    <li>Will probably remove implicit conversion of predicates to literals. Was a little overzealous - causes the compiler to make some annoying choices.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the TODO list for later:</p>

<ul>
<li>parser for sentences expressed as strings (mostly an excuse to play with ANTLR)</li>
</ul>
