# Roadmap

Clone the code and use your IDE's TODO/Task list functionality to see individual things I want to do.
This library will be "done" when I think that it does its "learning and experimentation" job adequately, and provides enough extension points for people to build on it should they so wish.

Priorities at the time of writing:
* Secondary storage/indexing support in the chaining knowledge bases
