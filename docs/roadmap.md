# Roadmap

Clone the repo and use your IDE's TODO/Task list functionality (TODOs are generally expressed as `// TODO..`) to see individual things I want to do.
This library will be "done" when I think that it does its "learning and experimentation" job adequately, and provides enough extension points for people to build on it should they so wish.

Priorities at the time of writing:
* A parser for sentences expressed as strings (mostly an excuse to play with ANTLR)
* Rule indexing support in the chaining knowledge bases
